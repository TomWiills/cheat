keir groves  2:37 PM
Should I have access to this now?
Tom Hines  2:37 PM
not yet hang on
keir groves  2:37 PM
Thanks
keir groves  4:27 PM
OK. So catkin make failed because of CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_workspace.cmake:95 (message):
  This workspace contains non-catkin packages in it
keir groves  4:35 PM
it failed on ohm and abandoned some other stuff

Tom Hines  5:14 PM
hmm
5:15
you did the whole gtest thing?
keir groves  5:15 PM
yeah
Tom Hines  5:15 PM
like the

cd /usr/src/gtest/build-aux
sudo cmake ..
sudo make
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib

bit too?
keir groves  5:16 PM
yeah
Tom Hines  5:16 PM
maybe try doing a catkin clean -y then a catkin build ohm
5:16
I'm not really sure though, that message should be resolved after doing the gtest thing
5:17
you have /usr/lib/libgtest.a and /usr/lib/libgtest_main.a?
keir groves  5:19 PM
gro166@hardware-ph:/usr/lib$ ls | grep libgtest
libgtest.a
libgtest_main.a
5:20
ohm build worked. one warning
Tom Hines  5:20 PM
great
keir groves  11:30 AM
Hi Tom, I finally got it all to build:man_dancing:
11:30
What's a good launch file to try for a single agent simulation?
Tom Hines  11:31 AM
Congratulations
11:31
subt_launch tunnel_simulation.launch
keir groves  12:09 PM
I have it running. Do you have some time this afternoon to show me how it works?
Tom Hines  12:12 PM
yeah
keir groves  12:12 PM
I cant get the robot to move. ohm mapping did die
keir groves  2:44 PM
OK, I havea moving robot!!! It's painfully slow though. Any ideas on how I might speed it up? Would putting the robot into a more basic world make it any faster?
Tom Hines  2:45 PM
it might but I would be surprised if it changes much
2:45
I'm not sure what other worlds we have
keir groves  2:45 PM
Is there anything rescouce heavy that I could kill?
Tom Hines  2:46 PM
possibly, you can run top or htop or something like that to see what the best candidates are
keir groves  2:46 PM
I was thinking one of the stock ones like playpen
Tom Hines  2:46 PM
the path to the world file is set in tunnel_simulation.launch so you can do that there I think
keir groves  2:47 PM
There seems to be some feature recognition stuff going on, purple dots, but I doubt thats to heavy?
Tom Hines  2:47 PM
yeah that's simulated, just detections when objects in gazebo get close enough
keir groves  2:47 PM
Ill try a different world and running gazebo without the gui
keir groves  3:10 PM
displaylinkmanager, vpnagentd, gzserver, gzclient are all really heavy
Tom Hines  3:10 PM
I don't know what the first 2 are
3:10
you definitely need gzserver
3:10
I can't remember if gzclient is just the gui or not though
keir groves  3:10 PM
gazebo?
Tom Hines  3:10 PM
might be unnecessary
3:11
yeah gzserver/gzclient are gazebo
3:11
are you using a vpn?
3:11
the displaylinkmanager is also suspicious
3:12
are you using a dock?
keir groves  3:12 PM
I dont think theres a vpn
3:12
yeah got a dock, three screens might be using a bit of juice
Tom Hines  3:13 PM
try sudo systemctl stop vpnagentd
3:13
yeah I think that displaylinkmanager is a dock thing
3:13
I know the linux software for my laptop's dock is garbage
keir groves  3:14 PM
hahaha
keir groves  4:39 PM
For future reference gzclient is the gui
Tom Hines  4:40 PM
cool
4:40
thanks
keir groves  4:43 PM
The simulation runs a bit better without the gazebo gui, with the dock unplugged and with that vpn thing killed
Tom Hines  4:43 PM
did changing the world help?
keir groves  5:08 PM
I'm just messing with that now
keir groves  10:54 AM
Hi Tom, I'm having trouble building ohm again.
10:55
this package doesn't like me
Tom Hines  10:55 AM
what's it say?

Tom Hines  10:56 AM
do you have pdal installed? (edited) 
keir groves  10:56 AM
not sure. I'll check
Tom Hines  11:00 AM
pdal provides las input and output
11:00
I think ohm will use it before liblas if it's available
keir groves  11:33 AM
I installed pdal and still get the same error
Tom Hines  11:37 AM
you have boost  1.65.1 installed right?
11:37
and wildcat 1:1.2.0-1444-g88a8025a-1
11:38
and libpdal-dev 1.6.0
11:39
and  no liblas (/opt/ros/melodic/lib/liblas.so should be from wildcat)
keir groves  11:49 AM
I think it was missing libpdal-dev
keir groves  11:56 AM
Ot of interest, what made you suspect that package?
Tom Hines  11:58 AM
las is a pointcloud file format, liblas is for las i/o, pdal also provides las i/o and I remember ohm having the option to choose what las i/o lib to use
11:58
I'm not sure if ohm uses boost
11:58
but if it does it must be a different one to what wildcat's liblas uses
keir groves  2:07 PM
OK, I think stuff has compiled right but the launch file isn't working.
2:08
I have open CL 2.1 installed. is that a problem?
Tom Hines  2:08 PM
see any errors?
keir groves  2:08 PM
It just hangs here:

Tom Hines  2:09 PM
did the gazebo loading screen open then just stay there?
2:09
if so check for something like "downloading models" in the logs
keir groves  2:09 PM
gazebo opens
Tom Hines  2:10 PM
what part of the launch file does not work?
keir groves  2:12 PM
No sure.

so it's just rviz that's not working?

I bet

dw if it's still not at real time factor of 1
2:34
I can't run it that fast either
keir groves  2:39 PM
its running at basically 1

I can get you husky today but I can't get you a pack

what's the password on husky computer?
Tom Hines  4:26 PM
ho-ho-ho
keir groves  4:42 PM
so if i ssh into husky the password is ho-ho-ho? for ssh do i need a username on husky? or just ssh 192.168.2.60
Tom Hines  4:42 PM
username is aslab
keir groves  4:45 PM
cheers i'm in
keir groves  10:52 AM
I got a wifi dongle and can ssh onto husky. I ran the launch file operations_station.launch but it failed. Am i missing any steps?

I haven't launched anything there
keir groves  11:12 AM
What do i need to install or launch on the robot?
11:13
I'm back in on ethernet
Tom Hines  11:13 AM
go to ~/subt/docker/
11:13
then run tmux so that you can reattach if your network goes down
11:13
then run ./run_dev.bash
11:14
then run roslaunch subt_launch autonomy.launch platform:=husky robot_name:=r2
11:14
hang on, I'll also need to reconfigure the pack a bit
11:14
well actually
11:14
you have to  do that since only you are connected
11:14
ssh to p2-xavier
11:15
then edit the file /etc/pack/pack.env I think
11:15
and change the WAIT line so that the --wait one is uncommented (edited) 
11:15
and the ROS_MASTER_URI line so that the husky-ph one is uncommented
keir groves  11:17 AM
what's the command to ssh onto p2-xavier
Tom Hines  11:17 AM
ssh aslab@p2-xavier
keir groves  11:18 AM
aha that makes sense.
11:18
all usernames are aslab?

can you ping husky-ph from the xavier?

yep
11:43
